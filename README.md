# Cocktail-Vue-public-

## Important Note
To utilize this project, make sure to download and run the Cocktail API project, as this project depends on it.

## Why this Approach?
We were required to build this project in Visual Studio, following the assignment from the lecturer. 
However, personally, I find working with Vue in projects, like the Portfolio project, more preferable.
This involves utilizing Vue with npm, allowing me to use Visual Studio Code.
This approach simplifies the development process, making it less complex and eliminating the need for controllers.

## Project Overview
This repository represents the front-end of my Cocktail project, with the Cocktail API serving as the back-end.
Here, the focus is on design and the fundamental use of Vue.js in conjunction with Axios to facilitate API calls.
