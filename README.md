# Cocktail-Vue-public-

## Info
To use this project, ensure you download and run the Cocktail API project, as this project relies on it.

We were required to build this project in Visual Studio, following the assignment from the lecturer. 
However, personally, I find working with Vue in projects, like the Portfolio project, more preferable. This involves utilizing Vue with npm, allowing me to use Visual Studio Code.
This approach simplifies the development process, making it less complex and eliminating the need for controllers.
